Creational, Structural and Behavioral patterns

Creational Patterns are concerned with object creation problems faced during software design. 
Object creation often results in design problems, 
creational patterns solve this problem by controlling the object creation.


A Factory Pattern or Factory Method Pattern says that just define an interface or abstract class 
for creating an object but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate. 
In other words, subclasses are responsible to create the instance of the class. 
 

Your design should always be “open for extension” but “closed for modifications”




Structural design pattern is a blueprint of how different objects and classes are combined together
to form a bigger structure for achieving multiple goals altogether. 




Behavioral Design Patterns provides a set of guidelines formulated by software pioneers 
that identify common communication patterns among objects and provide a way to solve 
commonly occurring object-interaction-related problems in software design
